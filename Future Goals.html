            <p>
                Being a part of Gonzaga and the Men's Tennis Team has been one of the greatest privileges of my life, allowing me to compete for something larger than myself. 
                As we approach the 2025 season, my goal is to contribute to my team’s success in the West Coast Conference and help us make history by qualifying for the NCAA tournament for the first time. 
               <br>
               <br>
                Beyond the college season, I am determined to earn my first professional ranking point over the summer, officially entering the ATP rankings. Additionally, I look forward to representing my hometown club during the offseason, striving to lead the team to promotion in Switzerland’s highest league.
                <br>
                <br>
                Academically, I am committed to maintaining my 4.0 GPA, which I have upheld throughout my freshman year. 
                I also aim to continue representing my team within the Student-Athlete Advisory Committee, ensuring that athletes’ voices are heard and making a positive impact within the Gonzaga community.
