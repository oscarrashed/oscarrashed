            <h1>About Me</h1>
            <p>
                Hello! My name is Oscar Rashed. I am a sophomore at Gonzaga University, where I am both studying and competing as a collegiate tennis player. 
                Though I grew up in Switzerland, my roots span across France, Italy, Lebanon, and Egypt, giving me a rich and diverse cultural background. 
                <br>
                <br>
                At 15, I made the bold decision to move to Barcelona, Spain, to chase my dream of becoming a Division 1 tennis player. 
                This journey not only shaped me as an athlete but also as an individual, instilling in me resilience, discipline, and an unwavering commitment to my goals. 
                <br>
                <br>
                Along the way, I have embraced the beauty of languages, becoming fluent in four. Beyond the court, I find joy in playing the guitar, immersing myself in books, and spending quality time with friends. 
                Academically, I am pursuing a Business major with minors in Philosophy and Entrepreneurship, allowing me to blend strategic thinking with creativity and innovation. 
                I take great pride in my relentless work ethic and strong mentalityâ€”two qualities that have defined my journey and continue to drive me toward success, both in sports and in life.
                <br>
                <br>
                Join me on this exciting adventure!
